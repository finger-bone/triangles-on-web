## 2D Basics

In this section, we learn about the basic concepts of computer graphics and WebGPU.

We do so by building a simple game called Life Game.

1. [Basic Setup](01.md)
2. [Life Game](02.md)
3. [Texture](03.md)

## 3D Basics

In this section, we learn about rendering 3D objects with WebGPU.

We first learn about the basic concepts of 3D rendering.

4. [Orthographic Projection](04.md)
5. [Perspective Projection](05.md)
6. [Lighting](06.md)

## WGSL

Then we talk about the elephant in the room- the shader language, wgsl.

7. [WGSL](07.md)

## 3D Models

This part familiarize you with OBJ file format and how to load 3D models.

8. [OBJ Model](08.md)

## Curves and Surfaces

Next part is about curves and surfaces.

9. [BÃ©zier Curve, B-spline Curve, and Surface](09.md)
